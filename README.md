# Cheese App

Simple app from the 'Android Architecture Components Paging Sample'.

This sample showcases the following Architecture Components:

* [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging.html)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
* [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ViewModel.html)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LiveData.html)

caveats: unnecessary complication by adding seperators. also requires paging 3. anyhow: reasonably simple example for paging.

### Features

This sample contains a single screen with a list of text items. Items can be added to the list with the input at the top, and swiping items in the list removes them.
